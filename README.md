# Music and Mental Health Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to the **Music and Mental Health Exploratory Data Analysis** project! This repository investigates the relationships between music preferences, listening habits, and mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD.

Music is a universal language that significantly impacts emotions, cognition, and mental well-being. This analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights that reveal how different genres, tempos, and listening behaviors influence mental health.

## Project Overview

This project leverages a dataset containing information about individuals' music preferences, listening habits, and mental health conditions. By exploring this data, we aim to understand potential correlations and trends.

### Key Objectives:
- Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
- Explore the relationships between music-related features and mental health outcomes.
- Visualize key insights and trends to communicate findings effectively.

## Features of the Analysis

- **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values, format columns, and ensure the dataset is analysis-ready.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarize key statistics for both numerical and categorical variables.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Is age and working hours affecting the mental health 
  - Relationships between music listening duration and mental health outcomes.
  - Heatmaps showing correlations between features.
- **Key Insights:**
  - Certain music genres may correlate with reduced symptoms of anxiety or depression.
  - Extended listening durations at high tempos might contribute to insomnia.
  - Relaxing or classical music genres show potential associations with improved mental health markers.
  - Patterns in music preferences and habits vary significantly across demographic groups.
